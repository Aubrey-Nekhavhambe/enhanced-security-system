# Enhanced Security System â€“ Digital Systems Project

This repository contains the **Enhanced Security System with Human, Vehicle Detection, and Keypad Access Control**, a **Digital Systems 4 group project** completed at **Vaal University of Technology (2024)**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary
Security breaches remain a serious risk to residential and commercial environments.  
This project aimed to **design and implement a multi-layered security system** by combining:
- Human detection (PIR sensor)  
- Vehicle detection (Ultrasonic sensor)  
- Keypad access control  
- LCD display for feedback  
- ESP32 microcontroller for processing and integration  

The system enhances perimeter protection and access control through real-time detection and secure authentication.
